**Overview of project**
Project : Sentiment Analysis of Tweets

**Objective **
The objective of the project is to perform the sentiment analysis on the dataset of the Tweets on Twitter.The task is to working on the specific NLP problem like a sentiment analysis or text classification So,I have done the project on the recognition of sentiment from the tweets.

**Key Activities**
1. **Dataset Cleaning**:
   - Ensure the dataset is free from inconsistencies and missing values.
   - Remove stopwords from the data and apply stemming.
2. **Data Splitting**:
   - Split the cleaned data into training and testing sets.
3. **Algorithm Application**:
   - Apply the logistic regression algorithm to determine probablistic output.
4. **Testing and Evaluation**:
   - Test the model and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics.
  
  **Technologies used**
1. **Python**  :Python is the primary programming language for the data analysis.
2. **Colab Notebook**: Employed for programming.
3. **numpy**   : It is fundamental library for numerical computing, providing support for large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, essential for data manipulation and analysis.
4.  **NLTK**   : Employed for natural language processing tasks, providing tools for text processing, tokenization, and sentiment analysis.
5. **Pandas**  : A powerful data manipulation library used for data cleaning, transformation.
6. **re**      : A module for regular expressions, used for text preprocessing and pattern matching.
7. **sklearn** : A machine learning library that includes tools for model building, evaluation, and various algorithms including logistic regression.
